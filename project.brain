# PF-Compression AI Interaction Guidelines

## Overview

This file provides guidelines for AI agents working on the PF-Compression project. It defines how AI should interact with the codebase, make decisions, and communicate with users.

## AI Interaction Principles

1. **Code-First Approach**: Focus on implementing functional code before optimizing.
2. **Incremental Development**: Build features incrementally, testing each step.
3. **Documentation**: Document code thoroughly with comments and update README files.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and provide clear error messages.
5. **User Experience**: Consider the end-user experience in all design decisions.

## Decision Making Framework

When making decisions about implementation:

1. Follow the specifications in .plan files when available
2. Adhere to the project's architectural patterns
3. Maintain consistency with existing code
4. Prioritize readability and maintainability
5. Consider performance implications, especially for real-time video processing

## Communication Guidelines

When communicating with users:

1. **Clarity**: Provide clear explanations of technical concepts
2. **Context**: Maintain context from previous interactions
3. **Options**: Present multiple options when appropriate
4. **Recommendations**: Make specific recommendations based on best practices
5. **Education**: Explain the reasoning behind recommendations

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Functionality**: Ensure core functionality works correctly
2. **Performance**: Optimize for real-time video processing
3. **Usability**: Create intuitive user interfaces
4. **Compatibility**: Ensure cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility
5. **Extensibility**: Design for future extensions and modifications

## Technology Stack Preferences

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Build Tools**: Bun, npm
- **Deployment**: Docker, Nginx
- **Testing**: Jest

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Video Processing

- Prioritize real-time performance
- Use WebGL for GPU acceleration when possible
- Implement fallbacks for browsers without WebGL support
- Consider memory usage for continuous video processing

### PWA Development

- Ensure offline functionality
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use responsive design for all screen sizes
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Continuous Improvement

This file should be updated as the project evolves and new patterns or best practices emerge.
